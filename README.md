# Instagram-like Web Application in Django

This repository is a copy of the `django_instagram_clone_youtube` project created by [Byron Lara](https://github.com/byronlara5) for his YouTube Django beginner tutorial.

I used this project to learn Django along with some of my classmates. I created this copy to follow the tutorial step-by-step. If you are interested, please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/byronlara5/django_instagram_clone_youtube).
